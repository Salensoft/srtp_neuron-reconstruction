1. This is an important day for us. We successfully create our SRTP-Repository called "srtp_neuron_reconstruction". And this is our first time to explore Github. It's really exciting and we all learn a lot from this web. We believe that this web will definitely give us a lot of convenience.

2. According to the modifying suggestion from out teacher, we update out PPT.
3. We also identify our works in short term, that is, Haoran Yuan is responsible for detailed research on the project background,  Ziqi Wen for revising our research plan and Haoran Ren is the master of our Github Repository.
