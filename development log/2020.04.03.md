1. This is an important day for us. We successfully created our SRTP-Repository, "srtp_neuron_reconstruction". And this is our first time to explore Github. It's really exciting and we are all learning a lot from this website. We believe that this website will definitely give us a lot of convenience.

2. According to the suggestion from our teacher, we updated our slides.
3. We also specified the division of labor in short term, that is, Yuan Haoran is responsible for improving the hierarchy in the project background research, Wen Ziqi for revising our research plan and Haoran Ren is the master of our Github Repository.
