# Highlights of the first group meeting (2020.03.29)

1. ### Details and format issues:

  · Personal names do not have black boxes;
  · Minimize unimportant text (for example, "project defense", the same reasoning for subsequent defenses);
  · Only the main points in the PPT, do not need large paragraphs of text;

2. ### Continuity issues:

  · The project team members should not be inserted in the middle of the PPT, but should be placed at the end of the PPT, detailing the members and division of labor of the team (with photos);
  · The level of background introduction is poor. In the defense PPT, it jumps directly from the large research background (brain science) to the specific research direction (neuronal structure reconstruction), and then to the research purpose (interactive debugging tool). The middle needs to be more clear Connection, such as why the study of neuron morphology can be translated into computer problems, and what are the corresponding industry needs;
  · After the background introduction, the "basic introduction of the project" should be changed to "research content";

3. ### Professional issues:

  · The PPT layout must be closely related to the project itself, and each picture must be able to correspond to the corresponding text description;
  · In the research plan, we should propose the corresponding technical means for specific problems, instead of describing the overall needs, and compare with another group: propose a support vector machine to solve the corresponding problem, but it is not specific enough, so the PPT of this group Major changes in research programs are needed;
  · The technical innovation should be clearly stated in the research plan;
  In terms of research schedules, preliminary preparations do not require much writing, and the technical issues to be overcome in each project's development stage should be highlighted;

4. ### Project implementation issues:

  · The actual progress of the project should be about 3 months faster than planned. Since the test week is to be avoided, the time period without the test and the winter and summer vacations must be fully utilized;
  · Keep a sufficient record of each question and exchange with the senior, and a full record of the bi-weekly group meeting;
  · Weekly record the research progress and experiment records of this week, and give corresponding measurement indicators for the experiment;
